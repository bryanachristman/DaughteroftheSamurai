      <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
      
      <h2>MY FIRST JOURNEY</h2>
      
      <p>That was one of the long <a href="#Nagaoka"> Nagaoka </a>winters.
         For five months we saw only snow. In the early spring our relatives in Tokyo had
         written that arrangements had been made for my school. From that time I had been
         waiting impatiently for the mountain roads to become safe from avalanches; for
         just as soon as we could travel <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>
         was to take me to the capital. </p>
      
      
      <p>At last the dykes were
         dry&#x2013;that was where the snow always melted first&#x2013;and we had a
         "gathering-green" picnic as a farewell to my companions in <a href="#Nagaoka"> Nagaoka </a> One sunny morning a group of us, with
         purple scarfs on our , heads and kimonos tucked up over our bright skirts, dotted the dykes slopes, each carrying a small basket and a bamboo knife
         and filling the air with laughter and merry calls as we hurried up and down the
         banks, trying to see how many different kinds of green each could find. Often in
         later years I recall that happy day as my last gay time at home as a girl. </p>
      
      
      <p>Finally the mail carriers reported that the overhanging snow-cliffs had all
         fallen and the slopes were clear. Soon after came the day of our departure. With
         a heart half of elation, half of regret, I bade good-bye to <a href="#HonourableGrandmother "> Honourable Grandmother </a> and <a href="#Mother"> Mother </a> and with misty eyes was carefully tucked into
         my jinrikisha by <a href="#Brother"> Ishi </a>. Then,
         between lines of bowing friends, our two jinrikishas and a baggageladen horse led by a coolie started
         on the eight-days' journey to Tokyo. </p>
      
      
      <p>Most of the way we travelled in jinrikishas, changing</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>them at certain towns, but occasionally we had to go on horseback. My saddle was
         a high box-seat; so <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> and the coolie
         rigged up a double-basket held by bands across the horse's back. I sat in one
         part, and baggage filled the other. As we went around the steep, curving road on
         the mountain side, I could lean over and look far, far down to the fisher
         villages on the coast. But it was more interesting, as we got farther along, to
         look across the deep valley to the sloping hillsides with their terraces of
         ricefields&#x2013;odd-shaped patches fitted in like the silk pieces of a Buddhist
         priest's robe. In every little village of thatch-roofed huts was a shrine set
         high in the midst of a few trees, and, half-hidden in a hollow beside a stream,
         was whirling the great narrow wheel of a rice-mill. The air was so clear that I
         could plainly see the awkward lunge of a water-buffalo as he dragged a wooden
         plough along the furrows of one of the rice-patches, and I could even
         distinguish a scarlet Bower stuck between the folds of the towel knotted about
         the head of the coolie behind. In those days no one ever wore a living Bower,
         except to carry it to the dead; so I knew he was taking it home for the house
         shrine. I wondered what kind of a home he had.</p>
      
      <p>I think it was our third day when I noticed that we were leaving the snow
         country. No longer did the towns have their sidewalks roofed, and these thatches
         bore no rows of avalanche stones. The houses looked bare and odd-like a married
         woman's face with newly shaved eyebrows. But we were not entirely beyond the
         sight of snow, for as we skirted <a href="#MyokoMountain"> Myoko Mountain
            </a> we saw a good many drifts and patches. The jinrikisha  men said snow
         lasted there until July .</p>
      
      <p>"From the top,"said <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>, "you
         can see <a href="#Fujiyama"> Fujiyama </a>&#x2013; "</p>
      
      <p>My heart thrilled, and I foolishly turned my head, feeling for a moment that I
         was really near the sacred</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>mountain which my eyes had never expected to behold. And then, with a deeper,
         warmer thrill, I heard the conclusion of his sentence:</p>
      
      <p>
         "&#x2013;and then, if you turn and look in the opposite direction, you can see
         the plains of <a href="#Echigo"> Echigo </a>."
         </p>
      
      <p>"We are very far away from home," I replied in a small voice.</p>
      
      <p><a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> gave a quick look at my grave face;
         then he laughed.</p>
      
      <p>
         "Also, if you look just beyond, you can see the <a href="#IsleofSado">
            Isle of Sado </a> .<a href="#Matsuo"> If Matsuo
            </a>should not come up to expectations, here's some advice for
         you."
         </p>
      
      <p>And his merry voice broke into an old song:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         
         <em>"Nikuiotoko ni ltiutai shima wa Royagoshi ni Sada ga
            shima."</em>
         
         </p>
      
      <p>I was shocked that<a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>should sing a
         common servant's song, and doubly shocked that he should joke so lightly about
         serious things; so my face was still grave as we rolled along in our
         jinrikishas.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <a href="#IsleofSado"> Isle of Sado </a> used to be a place of
         exile for criminalsand was considered by common people as the end of the world.
         This joking song, which is popular among peasant girls, is literally a threat to
         present to a disliked suitor, not the pleated garment which is the usual gift of
         the bride to a groom, but instead, a convict's garb: meaning, "I pray the
         gods will send the unwelcome one across the raging seas to the end of the
         world."</p>
      
      <p>We spent our fifth night at <a href="#Nagano"> Nagano </a> in the
         temple of <a href="#Zenkoji"> Zenkoji </a> where lived theroyal
         nun bene.athwhose high-lifted razor I had walked, years before, in a procession
         of gaily clad little girls, for a Buddhist ceremony of consecration.</p>
      
      <p>The next morning, soon after we started, <a href="#Brother"> Brother
            </a> halted and allowed my jinrikisha to roll up to his side.</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>"<a href="#Etsuko">Etsu-bo</a>,"he asked,"When did they
         give up making priestess of you?"</p>
      
      <p>"Why&#x2013;I don't know,"I said, suprised.</p>
      
      <p>He gave a little scornful laugh and rode on to his place ahead leaving me silent
         and thoughtful.</p>
      
      <p>I had spoken the truth when I said I did not know. I had always accepted my
         education with no thought of results. But <a href="#Brother"> Brother's
            </a> laugh had startled me, and, rolling along that mountain road, I did
         a good deal of thinking. At last I believed that I understood. I know my father
         had never approved, although he acquiesced in <a href="#HonourableGrandmother "> Honourable Grandmother;s </a> wish that I
         should be educated for a priestess; and when, after my <a href="#Brother">
            Brother's </a> sad departure, he had quietly substituted
         studieswhichwould be of benefit should I ever hold the position of his heir, I
         think <a href="#HonourableGrandmother "> Honourable Grandmother
            </a>, aching with sympathy for her proud, disappointed son, laid aside
         her cherished hope, and the plan was silently abandoned.</p>
      
      <p>In the province of <a href="#Shinano"> Shinano </a>, an hour or so
         from <a href="#Nagano"> Nagano </a>, my jinrikisha man pointed
         across the river to a small wooded mountain.</p>
      
      <p>"Obatsuyama, it is," he said.</p>
      
      <p>How my mind went back to <a href="#Ishi"> Ishi </a>and her
         mother-love story which tells of a time long, long ago, when there lived at the
         foot of this mountain a poor farmer and his aged widowed mother. They owned a
         bit of land which supplied them with food and their humble lives were peaceful
         and happy.</p>
      
      <p>At that time <a href="#Shinano"> Shinano </a>was governed by a
         despotic ruler who, though a brave warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking
         from anything suggestive of fading health and strength. This caused him to send
         out a cruel proclamat:ion. The entire province was given strict orders
         immediately to put to death all aged people.</p>
      
      <p>Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandon-</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>ing old people to die was not uncommon. However, it was not a law, and many of
         the helpless old lived as long as nature allowed in comfortable and welcome
         homes. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the
         order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought a second time about
         obeying the mandate of a daimio, so with many deep and hopeless sighs the youth
         prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.</p>
      
      <p>Just at sundown, when hois day's work was ended, he took a quantity of the
         unwhitened rice which is the principal food of the poor, cooked and dried it,
         and tying it in a square of cloth he swung the bundle around his neck along with
         a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to
         his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain.</p>
      
      <p>The road was long and steep. He plodded- steadily on, the shadows growing deeper
         and deeper, until the moon, round and clear, rose above the mountain-top and
         peered pityingly through the branches upon the youth toiling onward, his head
         bent with weariness and his heart heavy with sorrow. The narrow road was crossed
         and recrossed by many paths made by hunters and wood-cutters. In some places
         they mingled in a confused puzzle, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it
         mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward&#x2013;ever upward&#x2013;toward
         the high, bare summit of what is now known as Obatsuyama, mountain of the "Abandoning of the
         Aged."</p>
      
      <p>The eyes of the old mother were not so dim out that they noted the reckless
         hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son
         did not know the mountain's many paths, and his return might be one of danger,so
         she stretched forth herhand and snapping the twigs from the bushes as they
         passed, she</p>
      
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way, so as they climbed, the
         narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of
         twigs.</p>
      
      <p>At last the summit was reached. Weary and heartsick, the youth gently released
         his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort, as his last duty to the
         loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles he made a soft cushion, and tenderly
         lifting his old mother thereon, he wrapped her padded coat more closely about
         the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart said
         farewell.</p>
      
      <p>The trembling mother voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last
         injunction.</p>
      
      <p>
         "Let not thine eyes be blind, my son. The mountain road is full of danger.
         Look carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will
         guide thee to the familiar way farther down."
         </p>
      
      <p>The son's surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the 'poor old
         shrivelled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote
         him and, bowing to the ground, he cried aloud:</p>
      
      <p>
         "Oh, Honourable Mother, thy kindness thrusts my heart! I will not leave thee.
         Together'we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die I"
         </p>
      
      <p>Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now!) and hastened down
         the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the
         valley.</p>
      
      <p>Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered over
         and hidde&#x3bc; from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with
         everything needful and continually watching and fearing.</p>
      
      <p>Time passed and he was beginning to feel safe, when again the despot sent forth
         heralds bearing an unreasonable and useless order; seemingly as a boast of his
         power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.
         The entire province trembled with</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      
      <p>dread. The order must be obeyed; yet who in all <a href="#Shinano">
            Shinano </a>could make a rope of ashes?</p>
      
      <p>One night, in great distress, tne son whispered the news to his hidden
         mother.</p>
      
      <p>"Wait!"  she said, "I will think."</p>
      
      <p>On the second day she told him what to do.</p>
      
      <p>
         "Make a rope of twisted straw," she said, "then stretch it upon a row of flat
         stones and bum it there on a windless night."
         </p>
      
      <p>He called the people together and did as she said, and when the blaze had died,
         behold, upon the stones, with every twist and fibre showing perfect, lay a rope
         of whitened ashes.</p>
      
      <p>The <a href="daimio">daimio </a>was pleased at the wit of the youth,
         and praised him greatly, but demanded to know where he had obtained his
         wisdom.</p>
      
      <p>"Alas I Alas I" cried the farmer, "the truth must be told!" and
         with many deep bows he related his story.</p>
      
      <p>The daimio listened, then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head</p>
      
      <p>"<a href="#Shinano"> Shinano </a>needs more than the strength
         of youth," hesaid gravely. "Ah, that I should have forgotten the
         wellknown saying, 'With the crowri of snow, there cometh wisdom!'"</p>
      
      <p>That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and the custom drifted into so far a
         past that only the legend remains.</p>
      
      <p>As we went farther on, I found the customs so different from those of <a href="#Nagaoka"> Nagaoka </a> that I felt as if I were already in a
         strange land. At one place, long before we reached the village, we heard a
         hoarse voice calling,  Ma-kat-ta? Ma-kat-ta ?
         " (Is it sold? Is it sold?) and as we rolled
         through the one narrow, crowded street we saw an auctioneer standing high in the
         midst of dozens of bamboo baskets of beans, carrots, greens, and bamboo shoots;
         while lying around him, in ungainly confusion, were every</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>size and shape of purple eggplant and long, sprawling, delicious lotus roots.</p>
      
      <p><a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> looked back and laughed.</p>
      
      <p>"Who is he? What were all the people doing?" I asked, as soon as we
         reached the end of the long street and rolled out on to the public road.</p>
      
      <p>"It is a vegetable auction," <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>
         explained. "Merchants buy in quantities, and every morning the things are
         auctioned off by the basketful. Weren't those fine lotus roots? If we hadn't had
         breakfast only a couple of hours ago I'd believe I was hungry."</p>
      
      <p>At another place we went by a house where death had entered. Before the door
         stood a funeral palanquin into which coolies with big hats and crest-coats were
         just lifting the heavy wooden bucket containing the body. Over it was thrown a
         small kimono of
         scarlet and gold, showing that the dead child must have been a little daughter.
         The dress would have been white for a son. Around stood a number of white-robed
         mourners with white towels folded over their hair. As we passed, I caught a
         glimpse of a screen placed upside down and the lighted candles of a tiny
         shrine.</p>
      
      <p>At one place, where the road ran close to a broad river with bold bluffs coming
         down, in some places, almost to the water, we saw a number of odd floating
         rice-mills with turning paddle-wheels that looked like a fleet of boats standing
         motionless in a hopeless struggle against a strong tide. I wondered where, in
         that rocky country, were enough people to eat all the rice that was being
         r.round; but when we turned away from the river we suddenly found ourselves in a
         silk-culture district, where our road ran through village after village, each
         having its own mulberry plantation.</p>
      
      <p>The town where we expected to spend the night was only a few hours ahead when the
         sky began to darken with a</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>threatening storm. <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>was casting
         anxious looks backward when his jinrikisha man told him that in the next village was
         a large house where travellers had sometimes been kept for a night. So we
         hurried there, the last quarter of an hour being a bouncing, breathless race
         between men and clouds. The men won, whirling us up to the door, into which we
         ran unannounced, just as the storm broke with a downpour which it would have
         been hard to struggle through on the road.</p>
      
      <p>It was an odd house where we had found shelter; but I know that even my
         honourable father, on his journeys in ancient days, never, on any occasion,
         received a more cordial welcome or more kindly treatment than did we and our
         perspiring, laughing, boasting men at the end of our exciting race.</p>
      
      
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      
      <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
      
      <h2>TRAVEL EDUCATION</h2>
      
      <p>The large, well-cared-for house in which we had taken refuge that stormy night
         was crowded full of busy workers. With the exception of the living l'ooms of our
         host, his wife, and two daughters, the entire house was full of skeleton frames
         containing tiers and tiers of bamboo trays, each holding a network screen
         covered with silkworms. There must have been thousands and thousands of them. I
         had been accustomed to silkworms all my life. <a href="#Ishi"> Ishi's
            </a>home had been in a weaving village, and my elder sister had many silk
         villages on her three-mountain estate; but I never before had spent a night in
         sound of the continual nibbling of the hungry little creatures. It filled the
         whole house with a gentle rustling, exactly like the patter of raindrops on dry
         leaves, and I dreamed all night of dripping eaves. The next morning I awakened
         with a depressed feeling that I was to have a day's ride in a close-shut
         jinrikisha, and was surprised, when I pushed back one of the wooden panels at the porch
         edge, to find that the sun was shining.</p>
      
      <p>While I was standing there, one of the daughters, about my age, came out carrying
         a straw mat of silkworm waste to throw on a pile in the yard-for the mulberry
         stems and rice hulls of silkworm waste make the best fertilizer in the world-and
         she stopped to bow good-morning. Then she stood there in the June sunshine with
         her sleeves looped back and her bare feet in straw sandals, and I squatted</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>on the edge of the porch in my home-dyed night kimono , and we got acquainted.</p>
      
      <p>She told me that she took care of six trays of silkworms all by herself. She
         seemed to know everything about them, and she loved them.</p>
      
      <p>
         "They're clean," she said, "and dainty about food, and intelligent about
         their own affairs&#x2013;just like people."
         </p>
      
      <p>I was so interested in all the surprising things I heard that I was still
         listening when a girl came to fold away my bed cushions, and I had to hurry to
         get dressed.</p>
      
      <p> "Well," said <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>, after my room
         had been cleaned, and breakfast brought in,  "how do you like living in a
         boarding house?" </p>
      
      <p>"The boarders are very noisy," I replied; "and, from what our hostess's
         daughter told me, they are very particular. She says they cannot endure one
         particle of dust. Even a withered leaf will sometimes cause one to 'tie on his
         blue neckerchief' and creep to the outer edge of the tray."</p>
      
      <p>"Have you seen our host's grandmother?" asked <a href="#Brother">
            Brother </a>.</p>
      
      <p>
         "No, I didn't know there was a grandmother."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         "She went early to her cushions last night; probably to escape the bustle and
         annoyance of our abrupt arrival. We will pay our respects to her before we
         leave."
         </p>
      
      <p>When breakfast was over, our host took us to the grandmother's room. She was a
         very old lady with a reserved manner and a face of more than usual intelligence.
         As soon as she bowed I knew that she had been trained in a samurai house, and
         when I saw the crest of a <em>naginata</em> on the wall-rest
         above the <em>shoji</em>, I knew why <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> had wanted me to come to this room. </p>
      
      <p> A <em>naginata</em> is a long, light spear with curved blade,
         which samurai women were taught to use, partly for exercise and partly for
         defence in case of necessity. This </p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>one bore the crest of one of our northern heroes. He was a traitor, but
         nevertheless he was a hero. When he was killed, his daughter was one of the
         group&#x2013;three of them womenAs I mounted my jinrikisha  and bowed again to the entire
         group of family and servants bowing in the doorway, I could not help sending a
         thought farewell to the busy little boarders. I had learned more about silkworms
         during that shon rustling visit than in my fourteen years of life in a silkworm
         district. As we rolled along over a smooth, monotonous road my mind was busy,
         and I believe that then and there I first began to realize vaguely that all
         creatures, however insignificant, were "intelligent about their own affairs-just
         like people."who defended the sorely pressed castle during the last desperate
         hours of hopeless struggle. The old lady told us, with modest pride, that she
         had been a humble attendant of the daughter and was with her at that dreadful
         time. The <em>naginata</em> was a memory gift from her
         honourable and beloved mistress.</p>
      
      <p>Seeing that we were deeply interested, she brought out her other treasure--a
         slender, blunt knife called a <em>kogai</em>, which, with the
         throwing-dagger, forms part of the hilt of a samurai's long sword. In very
         ancient days Japanese warfare was a science. Artistic skill was always displayed
         in the use of weapons, and no soldier was proud of having wounded an enemy in
         any other manner than the one established by strict samurai rule. The long sword
         had for its goal only four points: the top of the head, the wrist, the side, and
         the leg below the knee. The throwingdagger must speed on its way, true as an
         arrow, direct to forehead, throat, or wrist. But the blunt little <em> kogai </em>had many uses. It was the key that locked the sword
         in its scabbard; when double it could be used as chopsticks by the marching
         soldier; it has been used on the battlefield, or in retreat, mercifully to
         pierce the ankle vein of a suffering and dying comrade, and it had the unique
         use in a clan feud, when found sticking upright in the ankle of a dead foe, of
         bearing the silent challenge, "I await thy return." Its crest told to whom it
         belonged and, in time, it generally was returned-to its owner's ankle. The <em> kogai </em>figures in many tales of romance and revenge of the
         Middle Ages.</p>
      
      <p>I was glad to see <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> so interested,
         and was happy myself in watching the old lady's face flush and light up with her
         memories; but her closing words made me feel</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>sorry. To some remark of <a href="#Brother"> Brother's </a> she
         replied, "Youth is always listening eagerly for marching orders; but the aged
         can only look backward to sad memories and hopeless dreams."</p>
      
      <p>As I mounted my jinrikisha and bowed again to the entire group of family and servants
         bowing in the doorway, I could not help sending a thought farewell to the busy
         little boarders. I had learned more about silkworms during that shon rustling
         visit than in my fourteen years of life in a silkworm district. As we rolled
         along over a smooth, monotonous road my mind was busy, and I believe that then
         and there I first began to realize&#x2013; vaguely&#x2013;that all creatures,
         however insignificant, were "intelligent about their own affairs&#x2013;just like
         people."</p>
      
      <p>"Dear me I" I finally said to myself. "How much we learn when we travel
         I" and I pulled the jinrikisha robe over my lap and settled myself for the long ride
         ahead.</p>
      
      <p>I think I must have gone to sleep, for I found myself crookedly but comfortably
         snuggled into almost a <em>kinoji </em>when I heard <a href="#Brother"> Brother's </a> voice.</p>
      
      <p>We were entering a good-sized town and he was leaning back and pointing across
         the tiled roofs to a castle on the hill beyond.</p>
      
      <p>
         "This is <a href="#Komoro"> Komoro </a>," he called, "and
         there's where the foot-high dolls came from."
         </p>
      
      <p>I smiled as my mind flew back to the <a href="#Nagaoka"> Nagaoka
            </a> home and pictured two enormous dolls of the festival set brought by
         our <a href="#Komoro"> Komoro </a> great-great-grandmother with
         her wedding dowry. In her day the Government permitted only the daughter of a
         daimio to own dolls a foot high, and her entire set must have been wondrously
         handsome. But in my time, when our living came principally from ,he visits of
         the second-hand man to our godown, the wondnful <a href="#Komoro"> Komoro
            </a>dolls, with their miniature furniture of gc Id and lacquer&#x2013;the
         perfection of Japanese art of the Middle</p>
      
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>Ages&#x2013;gradually found new homes. They went, I know, to no godown of Japan,
         but, through some shrewd dealer, into foreign hands and foreign lands and
         probably to-day are calmly resting in widely scattered homes and museums of
         Europe or America.</p>
      
      <p>Two of the dolls had become defaced in some way, and thus, being unsaleable, they
         were placed as ornaments on the high tokonoma shelf in my room. I was very fond of acting
         out scenes of the stories that were told me, and I used to take down the dolls
         and use them as an audience while I strutted around the room representing an
         ancient samurai with some fearful duty to perform. The dolls' heads were
         movable, and thus supplied a splendid opportunity for a favourite revenge story
         of mine. Many a time I have placed my hand on one of the enamelled heads and,
         with my ivory paper knife as a sword, have struck fiercely at the doll, at the
         same instant lifting out the head from its collar of rich brocade; then, with
         stern, set face, I would hurriedly wrap the head in a purple square of crepe
         and, tucking it under my arm, stride boldly off to an imaginary courtroom.</p>
      
      <p>I suspect my father knew of this barbarous game of mine, for I always borrowed
         his purple crepe <em> fukusa </em>for this purpose, feeling
         that something belonging to him would give dignity to the occasion; but I never
         heard <a href="#HonourableGrandmother "> Honourable Grandmother's
            </a> step on the porch that I did not quickly restore the head to its
         brocade nest in order to save her another anxious fear that I was growing too
         bold and rough ever to find a husband.</p>
      
      <p>As our jinrikishas rolled through the town I looked up at the castle with
         interest. And this was the home from which our <a href="#Komoro"> Komoro
            </a> grandmother had gone forth on her wedding journey to <a href="#Nagaoka"> Nagaoka </a> ! Half buried in trees it stood, the gray,
         tipped-up corners of many roofs peeping through the branches. It looked like a
         broad, low pa-</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>goda towering above a slanting wall of six-sided stones the "tortoise back" of
         all Japanese castles.</p>
      
      <p>From <a href="#Komoro"> Komoro </a> to <a href="#Nagaoka">
            Nagaoka </a> It must have seemed a long trip to the young girl in the
         teetering bridal <em>kago !</em> I thought of what <a href="#HonourableGrandmother "> Honourable Grandmother </a> had told me of
         her own month-long bridal trip. And then I looked ahead. The ldzumo  gods, who plan all
         marriages, had decreed the same fate for many brides of our family, and, so far
         as my own future was planned, I seemed destined to follow in the footsteps of my
         ancestors.</p>
      
      <p>At one place where we had to take <em> kagos</em> I disgraced
         myself. I dreaded a <em> kago</em>. The big basket swinging
         from the shoulders of the trotting coolies always made me dizzy and faint, but
         that day it was raining hard and the mountain path was too rough for a
         jinrikisha. I stood things as bravely as I could, but finally I became so sick that
         <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> had the baggage taken off the
         horse and, wedging me in between cushions on its back, covered me with a tent
         made of a straw mat and, disdaining comfort for himself, walked all the way up
         the mountain beside me, the coolie following with the two <em>
            kagos</em>.</p>
      
      <p>At the top the sun was shining, and when I peeped out from my tent <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>was shaking himself as my poor Shiro used to do when drenched
         with rain. I ventured to apologize in a shamed voice.</p>
      
      <p>
         "<em>Kago</em>sickness is a great absorber of pride,
         <a href="#Etsuko">Etsu-bo</a>. I'm afraid you have lost your
         right to be called your father's 'brave son."'
         </p>
      
      <p>I laughed, but my cheeks were hot.</p>
      
      <p>As he helped me to the ground, <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>
         pomted toward a wide-spreading cloud of smoke floating lazily above a
         cone-shaped mountain.</p>
      
      <p>
         "That's the signpost for the Robber Station," he said. "Do you remember?"
         </p>
      
      <p>Indeed I did. Many times I had heard Father tell the</p>
      
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>story of the small hotel at the top of a mountain where the rates were so high
         that people called it the 'Robber Station.' I was a big girl before I learned
         that it was a very respectable stopping place and not a den of thieves where
         money was extorted from travellers as tribute.</p>
      
      <p>We walked down the mountain, passing several cave shrines. In one I caught the
         twinkle of a burning lamp. lt reminded me of the hermit caves of <a href="Echigo">Echigo</a>. This was rr.y first long trip from home, and it
         was full of strange new experiences. Yet there seemed to be familiar memories
         connected with everything. I wondered vaguely if I should find it so in
         America.</p>
      
      <p>One day, after a shower, as the man stopped to lower the top of my
         jinrikisha, a sudden burst of sunshine showed rre, high up on the mountain-side, pressed
         flat against the green, an immense white dai, the Japanese character meanirg
         "great." It looked as if it had been painted with a brush, but <a href="#Jiya">Jiya</a>, who had once been there, had told me that it was
         made of strips of bamboo covered thickly with paper prayers tied on by pilgrim
         visitors to the temple en top of the mountain.</p>
      
      <p>Near by was the rude little village where <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>
         lived. She was <a href="#Jiya">Jiya's</a> sister, and we spent the
         night in her house. It was a queer place, a sort of cheap hotel for country
         people. <a href="Miyo">Miyo</a>, with her son and his wife, met us
         at the door with deep bows and many a <em>"Maa ! Maa !"
            </em>of surprise and pleasure. The wide entrance opened into a big room having
         a clay floor. Several casks bound with hoops of twisted bamboo were piled in one
         corner, and from the smoky ceiling hung a bulging bag of grain, bunches of mochi
         <em>mochi</em> cakes and dried fish, and bamboo baskets
         containing provisions of various kinds. </p>
      
      <p>We passed through a mob of chattering pilgrims who had just come down from the
         mountain, and, crossing the stones of a crude little garden, reached the
         rooms</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      
      <p>where <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>lived. Everything was clean, but the
         paper doors were patched, the mats yellow with age, and the cloth bindings worn
         almost through. <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>character who, in
         violation of all tradition, had cast off a worthless husband and brought up her
         four children herself. Of course it was very low class to do a thing like that,
         but she was as brave as a man, and, since her husband had no parents, she had
         been able legally to keep the children herself.</p>
      
      <p><a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>had been a servant in our house when
         <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> was a child, and her delight in
         seeing the "Young Master" was pathetic. Her bare feet went pattering over the
         mats, slipping quickly into her sandals each time she crossed the door-sill to
         the kitchen. She hurried here and there, bringing us the best she had and
         offering everything with bows and apologies. One thing troubled her very much.
         She had only wooden trays with no feet, and she had never known my <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a> to eat off a low tray. In the days when she
         lived at our house, even an informal serving of cake was presented to him on a
         high lacquer stand, just as it was to Father. But she was ingenious, and
         presently she brought in a brassbound rice-bucket and with many bows and an
         anxious "Please grant your honourable pardon!" placed the tray on it before
         <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>.He laughed heartily and said
         that even a shogun had never received a similar honour.</p>
      
      <p>We sat up very late and had a most interesting time. <a href="#Brother">
            Brother </a> talked of past days and of many things about our home, so
         little known to me that I felt as if I were reading some old, half-familiar
         book. I had never known him to be so free and merry as he was that evening. And
         <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>, half laughter and half tears, talked
         rapidly, asking many questions and interrupting herself continually. She was</p>
      
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>reminding him of some incident of his childhood, when he abruptly asked: "What
         became of your 'own-choice' husband, <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo
            </a>?"</p>
      
      <p>I thought that question was too cruel, but <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo
            </a> calmly replied: "Young Master, 'The rust of one's own sword can
         be brightened only by one's own effort.' I am still paying the penalty of my
         life mistake."</p>
      
      <p>Very gravely she went across the room to a big chest and took out a small, flat
         package. It was a square of purple crepe bearing our crest. With a serious face
         she unfolded it, showing a brocade charm bag such as we children used to wear to
         hold the paper blessing of the priest. The gold threads were a little ravelled
         and the heavy scarlet cord mellowed with age.</p>
      
      <p><a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>lifted it reverently to her forehead.</p>
      
      <p>
         "The Honourable Mistress gave it to me," she said to <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>, "the night she let my lover and me through the water
         gate. It held square silver coins&#x2013;all that I needed."
         </p>
      
      
      <p> "Ah!" <a href="#Brother"> Brother </a>exclaimed excitedly,
         "I know! I was a little boy. It was dark and I saw her coming back alone,
         carrying a lantern. But I never understood what it meant."</p>
      
      <p><a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>hesitated a moment; then she told us.</p>
      
      <p>When she was employed in our house, she was very young, and because she was the
         sister of Father's faithful <a href="#Jiya">Jiya</a>, she was
         allowed much freedom. A youthful servant, also of our house, fell in love with
         her. For young people to become lovers without the sanction of proper
         formalities was a grave offence in any class, but in a samurai household it was
         a black disgrace to the house. The penalty was exile through the water
         gate&#x2013;a gate of brush built over a stream and never used except by one of
         the eta,  or
         outcast,. The departure was public, and the culprits were</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      
      <p>ever after shunned by everyone. The penalty was unspeakably cruel, but in the old
         days severe measures were used as a preventive of law-breaking.</p>
      
      <p>Mother always rigidly obeyed every law of the household, but she saved
         <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a> from public disgrace by taking the
         lovers quietly, at midnight, and herself opening the big swinging gate for them
         to pass. No one ever knew the truth.</p>
      
      <p>"It is said," concluded <a href="#Miyo"> Miyo </a>sadly,
         "that the hearts of those who pass the water gate are purified by the gods;
         but even so, the penalty of a law-breaker can never be evaded. In secret I have
         paid the penalty, and my children were saved from disgrace by the heavenly
         kindness of the Honourable Mistress of the Inagaki."</p>
      
      <p>We all sat quiet for a moment. Then <a href="#Brother"> Brother
            </a>said bitterly:</p>
      
      <p>
         "The Honourable Mistress of the Inagaki was many times more merciful to the
         servants of her household than to her one and only son."
         </p>
      
      <p>Impatiently he pushed his cushion aside and abruptly said good-night.</p>
      
      <p>The next morning our road wound along the side of a mountain stream awkwardly
         threading its way through a series of angular gullies, finally ending abruptly
         in a swift, sloping leap into a wide, shallow river, which we crossed on a boat
         poled by coolies. This river was the scene of one of <a href="#Jiya">Jiya's</a> most exciting stories. Father, on one of his hurried trips to
         Tokyo, had found it flooded and had ordered his coolies to place his palanquin
         on a platform and carry it on their heads through the whirling waves to the
         opposite shore. One man was drowned.</p>
      
      <p>As our jinrikishas rolled along I thought of how often Father had gone over
         that road amidst the state and pomp of old Japan; and now his two dear
         ones&#x2013;his eldest and his youngest&#x2013;were following the same path in
         rented</p>
      
      <pb></pb>
      
      <p>jinrikishas, simply garbed and with no attendants except a wheezy old coolie with a
         baggage horse. How strange it seemed.</p>
      
      <p>At last we reached <a href="#Takasaki">Takasaki </a>&#x2013;the
         place from which the celebrated "land steamer" started on its puffing way to
         Tokyo. That was the first time that I ever saw a railway train. It looked to me
         like a long row of little rooms, each with a narrow door opening on to the
         platform.</p>
      
      <p>It was late in the afternoon, and I was so weary that I have little recollection
         of anything except a scolding from <a href="#Brother"> Brother
            </a>, because I, feeling that I was entering some kind of a house,
         stepped out of my wooden shoes, leaving them on the platform. Just before the
         train started, they were handed in at the window by an official whose special
         duty it was to gather all the shoes from the platform before the starting of
         every train. I went to sleep at once, and the next thing I knew we were in
         Tokyo.</p>
