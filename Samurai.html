         <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
         
         <h2>LESSONS</h2>
         
         <p>OUR time in school was supposed to be equally divided between Japanese and
            English, but since I had been already carefully drilled in Japanese studies, I
            was able to put my best efforts on English. My knowledge of that language was
            very limited. I could read and write a little, but my spoken English was
            scarcely understandable. I had, however, read a number of translations of
            English books and&#x2014;valuable than all else&#x2014;I possessed a supply of
            scattered knowledge obtained from a little set of books that my father had
            brought me from the <a href="#Tokyo">capital</a> when I was only
            a child. They were translations, compiled from various sources and published by
            one of the progressive book houses of <a href="#Tokyo">Tokyo</a>.</p>
         
         <p>I do not know whose idea it was to translate and publish those ten little paper
            volumes, but whoever it was holds my lasting gratitude. They brought the first
            shafts of light that opened to my eager mind the wonders of the Western world,
            and from them I was led to countless other friends and companions who, in the
            years since, have brought to me such a wealth of knowledge and happiness that I
            cannot think what life would have been without them. How well I remember the day
            they came! Father had gone to <a href="#Tokyo">Tokyo</a> on one
            of his &#x201c;window toward growing days&#x201d; trips.</p>
         
         <p>That was always an important event in our lives, for he brought back with him,
            not only wonderful stories of his journey, but also gifts of strange and
            beautiful things. Mother had said that he would be home at the close of the day,
            and I spent the afternoon sitting on the porch step watching the
            slow-lengthening shadows of the garden trees. I had placed my high wooden clogs
            on a stepping-stone just at the edge of the longest shadow, and as the sun crept
            farther I moved them from stone to stone, following the sunshine. I think I must
            have had a vague feeling that I could thus hasten the slanting shadow into the
            long straight line which would mean sunset.</p>
         
         <p>At last&#x2014;at last&#x2014;and before the shadow had quite straightened, I
            hurriedly snatched up the clogs and clattered across the stones, for I had heard
            the <a href="#def1">jinrikisha</a> man's cry of <a href="#def2">&#x201c;<em>Okaeri!</em>&#x201d;</a>
            just outside the gate. I could scarcely bear my joy, and I have a bit of guilt
            in my heart yet when I recall how crookedly I pushed those clogs into the neat
            box of shelves in the &#x201c;shoe-off&#x201d; alcove of the vestibule.</p>
         
         <p>The next moment the men, perspiring and laughing, came trotting up to the door
            where we, servants and all, were gathered, our heads bowed to the floor, all in
            a quiver of excitement and delight, but of course everybody gravely saying the
            proper words of greeting. Then, my duty done, I was caught up in my father's
            arms and we went to Honourable Grandmother, who was the only one of the
            household who might wait in her room for the coming of the master of the
            house.</p>
         
         <p>That day was one of the &#x201c;memory stones&#x201d; of my life, for among all the
            wonderful and beautiful things which were taken from the willow-wood boxes
            straddled over the shoulders of the servants was the set of books for me. I can
            see them now. Ten small volumes of tough Japanese paper, tied together with silk
            cord and marked, <a href="#WesternSeas">&#x201c;Tales of the Western
               Seas.&#x201d;</a> They held extracts from <a href="#WorldHistory">&#x201c;Peter Parley's World History,&#x201d;</a>
            <a href="#NationalReader">&#x201c;National Reader,&#x201d;</a>
            <a href="#WilsonsReaders">&#x201c;Wilson's Readers,&#x201d;</a> and many short
            poems and tales from classic authors in English literature.</p>
         
         <p>The charm of delight that rare things give came to me during days and
            weeks&#x2014;even months and years&#x2014;from those books. I can recite whole
            pages of them now. There was a most interesting story of <a href="#Colombus">Christopher Columbus.</a> It was not translated
            literally, but adapted so that the Japanese mind would readily grasp the thought
            without being buried in a puzzling mass of strange customs. All facts of the
            wonderful discovery were stated truthfully, but <a href="#Colombus">Columbus</a> was pictured as a fisher lad, and somewhere in the
            story there figured a lacquer bowl and a pair of chopsticks.</p>
         
         <p>These books had been my inspiration during all my years of childhood, and when,
            in my study of English at school, my clumsy mind began to grasp the fact that,
            hidden beneath the puzzling words were continuations of stories I knew, and of
            ideas similar to those I had found in the old familiar books that I had loved so
            well, my delight was unbounded. Then I began to read eagerly. I would bend over
            my desk, hurrying, guessing, skipping whole lines, stumbling along&#x2014;my
            dictionary wide open beside me, but I not having time to look&#x2014;and yet, in
            some marvellous way, catching ideas. And I never wearied. The fascination was
            like that of a moon-gazing party, where, while we watched from the hillside
            platform, a floating cloud would sail across the glorious disk, and
            we&#x2014;silent, trembling with excitement&#x2014;would wait for the glory of the
            coming moment. In the same way, a half-hidden thought&#x2014;elusive,
            tantalizing&#x2014;would fill me with a breathless hope that the next moment
            light would come. Another thing about English books was that, as I read, I was
            constantly discovering shadowy replies to the unanswered questions of my
            childhood. Oh, English books were a source of deepest joy!</p>
         
         <p>"I am afraid that I should not have been so persistent, or so successful in my
            English studies, could I have readily obtained translations of the books I was
            so eager to read. <a href="#Tokyo">Tokyo</a> bookshops, at that
            time, were beginning to be flooded with translations of English, French, German,
            and Russian books; and these generally, if not scientific treatises, were
            classics translated, as a rule, by our best scholars; but they were expensive to
            purchase and difficult for me to obtain in any other way. To read, even
            stumblingly, in the original, the books in the school library was my only
            resource, and it became one of my greatest pleasures.</p>
         
         <p>Excepting English, of all my studies history was the favourite; and I liked and
            understood best the historical books of the <a href="#OldTestament">Old
               Testament.</a> The figurative language was something like Japanese; the
            old heroes had the same virtues and the same weaknesses of our ancient <a href="#def3">samurai</a>; the patriarchal form of government
            was like ours, and the family system based upon it pictured so plainly our own
            homes that the meaning of many questioned passages was far less puzzling to me
            than were the explanations of the foreign teachers.</p>
         
         <p>In my study of English literature, it seems odd that, of all the treasures that I
            gathered, the one which has been most lasting as a vivid picture, is that of
            <a href="#Tennyson">Tennyson</a>'s <a href="#Dora">&#x201c;Dora.&#x201d;</a> Probably this was because of its having been used by a
            <a href="#Kencho">famous Japanese writer</a> as the foundation
            of a novel called <a href=""><a href="#Tanima">&#x201c;Tanima no Himeyuri.&#x201d;</a></a>&#x2014;Lily of the Valley. The story of Dora, being a tale
            of the first-born of an aristocratic family disinherited because he loved a
            rustic lass of humble class; and the subsequent tragedy resulting from the
            difference in training of different social circles, was a tale familiar and
            understandable to us. It was skilfully handled, the author, with wonderful word
            pictures, adapting Western life and thought to Japanese conditions.</p>
         
         <p><a href="#Tanima">&#x201c;The Lily of the Valley&#x201d;</a> appeared at just the
            time when the young mind of Japan, both high and humble, was beginning to seek
            emancipation from the stoic philosophy, which for centuries had been the core of
            our well-bred training, and it touched the heart of the public. The book rushed
            with a storm of popularity all through the land and was read by all classes;
            and&#x2014;which was unusual&#x2014;by both men and women. It is said that
            <a href="#Shoken">Her Imperial Majesty</a> became so interested
            in reading it that she sat up all one night while her court ladies, sitting
            silent in the next room, wearily waited.</p>
         
         <p>I think it was my third year in school that a wave of excitement over love
            stories struck <a href="#Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. All the schoolgirls
            were wildly interested. When translations were to be had we passed them from
            hand to hand through the school; but mostly we had to struggle along in English,
            picking out love scenes from the novels and poems in our school library. <a href="#EnochArden">Enoch Arden</a> was our hero. We were familiar with
            loyalty and sacrifice on the part of a wife, and understood perfectly why Annie
            should have so long withstood the advances of Philip, but the unselfishness of
            the faithful Enoch was so rare as to be much appreciated.</p>
         
         <p>The hearts of Japanese girls are no different from those of girls of other
            countries, but for centuries, especially in <a href="#def3">samurai</a> homes, we had been strictly trained to regard duty, not
            feeling, as the standard of relations between man and woman. Thus our unguided
            reading sometimes gave us warped ideas on this unknown subject. The impression I
            received was that love as pictured in Western books was interesting and
            pleasant, sometimes beautiful in sacrifice like that of Enoch Arden; but not to
            be compared in strength, nobility, or loftiness of spirit to the affection of
            parent for child, or the loyalty between lord and vassal.</p>
         
         <p>Had my opinion been allowed to remain wordless, it probably would never have
            caused me annoyance, but it was destined to see the light. We had a very
            interesting literature society which held an occasional special meeting, to
            which we invited the teachers as guests. With an anxious pride to have a fine
            entertainment, we frequently planned our programme first and afterward selected
            the girls for the various tasks. The result was that sometimes the subject
            chosen was beyond the capacity of the girl to handle. At one time this rule
            brought disaster to me, for we never shirked any duty to which we were
            assigned.</p>
         
         <p>On this occasion I was asked to prepare a three-page essay in English, having one
            of the cardinal virtues for a subject. I puzzled over which to select of Faith,
            Hope, Charity, Love, Prudence, and Patience; but recalling that our Bible
            teacher frequently quoted &#x201c;God is Love,&#x201d; I felt that there I had a
            foundation, and so chose as my topic, &#x201c;Love.&#x201d; I began with the love of
            the Divine Father, then, under the influence of my late reading, I drifted
            along, rather vaguely, I fear, on the effect of love on the lives of celebrated
            characters in history and poetry. But I did not know how to handle so awkward a
            subject, and reached my limit in both knowledge and vocabulary before the three
            pages were filled. Faithfulness to duty, however, still held firm, and I wrote
            on, finally concluding with these words: &#x201c;Love is like a powerful medicine.
            When properly used it will prove a pleasant tonic, and sometimes may even
            preserve life; but when misused, it can ruin nations, as seen in the lives
            of <a href="#Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> and the beloved <a href="#ChineseEmpress">Empress of the Emperor Genso of Great
               China</a>.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>At the close of my reading one teacher remarked, &#x201c;This is almost
            desecration.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>It was years before I understood what the criticism meant.</p>
         
         <p>For a while my great interest in English reading filled all my hours of leisure,
            but there came a time when my heart longed for the dear old stories of Japan,
            and I wrote to my mother asking her to send me some books from home. Among
            others she selected a popular classic called <a href="#Hakkenden">&#x201c;Hakkenden,&#x201d;</a> which I especially loved. It is
            the longest novel ever written in the Japanese language, and our copy,
            Japanese-bound and elaborately illustrated, consisted of 180 volumes. With great
            effort Mother succeeded in obtaining a foreign-bound copy in two thick volumes.
            I welcomed these books with joy, and was amazed when one of the teachers, seeing
            them in my bookcase, took them away, saying they were not proper books for me to
            read.</p>
         
         <p>To me, <a href="#Hakkenden">
               &#x201c;Hakkenden,&#x201d;</a> with its wonderful symbolism, was one of the
            most inspiring books I had ever read. It was written in the 18th Century by
            <a href="#Bakin">Bakin</a>, our great philosopher-novelist, and
            so musical is the literature, and so lofty the ideals, that frequently it has
            been compared, by Japanese of learning, to <a href="#Milton">Milton</a>&#x2019;s <a href="#ParadiseLost">&#x201c;Paradise
               Lost&#x201d;</a> and the <a href="#DivineComedy">&#x201c;Divine
               Comedy&#x201d;</a> of <a href="#Dante">Dante</a>. The
            <a href="#Bakin">author</a> was a strong believer in the
            unusual theory of spiritual transmigration, and his story is based on that
            belief.</p>
         
         <p>The tale is of the <a href="#def4">daimio</a> Satomi, who,
            with his almost starving retainers, was holding his castle against a besieging
            army. Knowing that the strength of the enemy lay alone in their able general, he
            desperately offered everything he possessed, even to his precious daughter, to
            any one brave enough to destroy his enemy. Satomi's faithful dog, a handsome
            wolf-hound named Yatsubusa, bounded away, and the next morning appeared before
            his master, carrying by its long hair the head of Satomi's foe. With their
            leader gone the enemy was thrown into confusion, and Satomi's warriors, with a
            mighty rush, put them to flight. Thus was the province restored to peace and
            prosperity. Then, so bitterly did Satomi regret his promise that he was enraged
            at the very sight of the faithful animal to whom he owed his good fortune. But
            his beautiful daughter, the Princess Fuse, pitied the wronged animal.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;The word of a <a href="#def3">samurai</a>, once uttered,
            cannot be recalled,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It is my duty to uphold the honour of
            my father's word.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>So the filial daughter went with Yatsubusa to a mountain cave where she spent her
            time in praying to the gods that a soul might be given to the brave animal; and
            with every murmured prayer the noble nature of the dumb Yatsubusa drew nearer to
            the border line of human intelligence.</p>
         
         <p>One day there came to the mountain a loyal retainer of Satomi. He saw, just
            within the cave, the Princess Fuse sitting before the shrine holding an open
            book. Before her, like a faithful vassal, Yatsubusa listened with bowed head to
            the holy reading. Believing he was doing a noble deed, the retainer lifted his
            gun and fired. The bullet, swift and strong, was guided by fate. It passed
            directly through the body of Yatsubusa and on, piercing the heart of the
            Princess Fuse.</p>
         
         <p>At that instant the freed spirit of the Princess, as eight shining stars in a
            floating mist, rose from her body and floated softly through the sky to the
            eight corners of the world. Each star was a virtue: Loyalty, Sincerity, Filial
            Piety, Friendship, Charity, Righteousness, Courtesy, and Wisdom.</p>
         
         <p>Fate guided each star to a human home, and in course of time, into each of these
            homes a son was born. As they blossomed into manhood, Fate brought the youths
            together, and the reunited eight virtues become heroic vassals, through whom
            came glory to the name of Satomi. So the spirit of the filial daughter brought
            honour to her father's name.</p>
         
         <p>I could not understand why this miracle-story, filled with lofty symbolism, could
            be more objectionable than the many fables and fairy tales of personified
            animals that I had read in English literature. But, after much pondering, I
            concluded that thoughts, like the language, on one side of the world are
            straightforward and literal; and on the other, vague, mystical, and
            visionary.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of my school life my beloved books were returned to me. I have them
            now&#x2014;battered, loose-leafed, and worn&#x2014;and I still love them.</p>
         
         <p>As time passed on, I learned to like almost everything about my school&#x2014;even
            many of the things which at first I had found most trying; but there was one
            thing which from the very first I had enjoyed with my whole heart. The school
            building was surrounded by large grounds with tall trees. A small lawn near the
            principal doorway was well cared for, but beyond was an extensive stretch of
            weedy grass and untrained shrubbery. There were no stone lanterns, no pond with
            darting gold-fish, and no curving bridge; just big trees with unbound branches,
            uncut grass, and&#x2014;freedom to grow.</p>
         
         <p>At my home there was one part of the garden that was supposed to be wild. The
            trees were twisted like wind-blown mountain pines; the stepping-stones marked an
            irregular path across ground covered with pine needles; the fence was of growing
            cedar peeping between uneven rods of split bamboo, and the gate was of brushwood
            tied with rough twine. But someone was always busy trimming the pines or cutting
            the hedge, and every morning Jiya wiped off the stepping-stones and, after
            sweeping beneath the pine trees, carefully scattered fresh pine needles gathered
            from the forest. There the wildness was only constant repression, but here at
            the school everything was filled with the uplifting freshness of unrestrained
            freedom. This I enjoyed with a happiness so great that the very fact that such
            happiness could exist in the human heart was a surprise to me.</p>
         
         <p>One section of this wild ground the teachers divided into small gardens, giving
            one to each of the girls and providing any kind of flower seeds we wanted. This
            was a new delight. I already loved the free growth of the trees, and the grass
            on which I could walk even in my shoes; but this &#x201c;plant-what-you-please&#x201d;
            garden gave me a wholly new feeling of personal right. I, with no violation of
            tradition, no stain on the family name, no shock to parent, teacher, or
            townspeople, no harm to anything in the world, was free to act. So instead of
            having a low bamboo fence around my garden, as most of the girls had, I went to
            the kitchen and coaxed the cook to give me some dried branches used for
            kindling. Then I made a rustic hedge, and, in my garden, instead of flowers, I
            planted&#x2014;potatoes.</p>
         
         <p>No one knows the sense of reckless freedom which this absurd act gave
            me&#x2014;nor the consequences to which it led. It had unloosed my soul, and I
            stood listening, while from a strange tangle of unconventional smiles and
            informal acts, of outspoken words and unhidden thoughts, of growing trees and
            untouched grass, the spirit of freedom came knocking at my door.</p>

         <h2>CHAPTER XV </h2>
         
         <h2> HOW I BECAME A CHRISTIAN</h2>
         
         <p>IN MY <a href="#Nagaoka">Nagaoka</a> home, notwithstanding the
            love and care that surrounded me, my mind was always filled with unanswered
            questions. My education as a priestess had developed my mind, but it had grown
            in cramped silence; for, liberal as was my father in his views regarding my
            training, I was influenced by the home atmosphere of conservatism, and rarely
            spoke, even to him, of my inmost thoughts.</p>
         
         <p>But occasionally this reserve was broken. Once, just after I had made many bows
            of farewell to the departing guests of the three-hundredth death celebration of
            an ancestor, I asked:</p>
         
         <p>
            &#x201c;Honourable Father, who is the first, the away-back, the very beginning of
            our ancestors?&#x201d;
            </p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;Little daughter,&#x201d; Father gravely answered, &#x201c;that is a presumptuous
            question for a well-bred girl to ask; but I will be honest and tell you that
            I do not know. Our great <a href="#Confucius">Confucius</a>
            replied to his disciple concerning that very question, 'We know not
            life.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>I was very young, but I well understood that I must in the future be more demure
            and womanly in my inquiries, and not ask questions with the freedom of a
            boy.</p>
         
         <p>The influence of my school life in <a href="#Tokyo">Tokyo</a> had
            been subtle. Unconsciously I had expanded, until gradually I became convinced
            that asking questions was only a part of normal development. Then, for the first
            time in my life, I attempted to put into words some of the secret thoughts of my
            heart. This was gently encouraged by my tactful teachers; and, as time passed
            on, I realized more and more that they were wonderfully wise for women, and my
            confidence in them grew. Not only this, but their effortless influence to
            inspire happiness changed my entire outlook on life. My childhood had been
            happy, but it had never known one throb of what may be called joyousness. I used
            to gaze at the full moon sailing in the deep sky, with all the poetic ecstasy of
            the Japanese heart, but always, like a shadow, came the thought, &#x201c;It will
            grow less from to-night.&#x201d; Our flower viewings were a delight to me, but
            invariably, as I travelled homeward, I sighed to myself: &#x201c;The lovely blossoms
            will fall before the winds of tomorrow.&#x201d; So it was with everything. In
            the midst of gladness I unconsciously sent out a heart search for a thread of
            sadness. I ascribe this morbid tendency to the Buddhist teaching of my
            childhood; for there is a strain of hopeless sadness in all
            Buddhist thought.</p>
         
         <p>But my life at school blew into my heart a breath of healthful cheerfulness. As
            the restraint which had held me like a vise began to relax, so also there melted
            within me the tendency to melancholy. It could not be otherwise; for the
            teachers, whether working, playing, laughing, or even reproving, were a
            continual surprise. In my home, surprises had been infrequent. People bowed,
            walked, talked, and smiled exactly as they had bowed, walked, talked, and smiled
            yesterday, and the day before, and in all past time. But these astonishing
            teachers were never the same. They changed so unexpectedly in voice and manner
            with each person to whom they spoke, that their very changeableness was a
            refreshing attraction. They reminded me of cherry blossoms.</p>
         
         <p>Japanese people love flowers for what they mean. I was taught from babyhood that
            the plum, bravely pushing its blossoms through the snows of early spring, is our
            bridal flower because it is an emblem of duty through hardship. The cherry is
            beautiful and it never fades, for the lightest breeze scatters the still fresh
            and fragrant petals into another beauty of tinted, floating clouds; which again
            changes to a carpet of delicate white-and-pink shells&#x2014;like my teachers,
            always changing and always beautiful.</p>
         
         <p>Although I now know that my first impressions of American womanhood were
            exaggerated, I have never regretted this idealization; for through it I came to
            realize the tragic truth that the Japanese woman&#x2014;like the plum blossom,
            modest, gentle, and bearing unjust hardship without complaint&#x2014;is often
            little else than a useless sacrifice; while the American
            woman&#x2014;self-respecting, untrammelled, changing with quick adaptability to
            new conditions&#x2014;carries inspiration to every heart, because her life, like
            the blossom of the cherry, blooms in freedom and naturalness.</p>
         
         <p>This realization was of slow growth, and it brought with it much silent
            questioning.</p>
         
         <p>From childhood I had known, as did all Japanese people, that woman is greatly
            inferior to man. This I never questioned. It was fate. But as I grew older I so
            constantly saw that fate brings inconvenience and humiliation to blameless
            people that I fell into a habit of puzzling, in a crude, childish way, over this
            great unkind Power. At last a day came when my heart broke into open
            rebellion.</p>
         
         <p>Ever since the hard days before the Restoration<a href="#note1">*</a>, my
            mother had been subject to occasional attacks of asthma, which we all were
            sincere in believing was due to some unknown wrong committed by her in a
            previous existence. Once when, after a breathless struggle, I heard her gasp,
            &#x201c;It is fate and must be borne,&#x201d; I ran to Ishi and asked indignantly
            why fate made my mother suffer.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;It cannot be helped,&#x201d; she replied, with pitying tears in her eyes. &#x201c;It
            is because of the unworthiness of woman. But you must be calm, <a href="#Etsu">Etsu-bo Sama</a>. The Honourable Mistress does not
            complain. She is proud to bear silently.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>I was too young to understand, but, with my heart pounding in hot rebellion
            against the powerful, mysterious injustice, I pulled myself into Ishi's lap and,
            convulsively clinging to her, begged her to tell me a story&#x2014;quick&#x2014;of
            clashing swords, and flying arrows, and heroes who fought and won.</p>
         
         <p>Japanese children were not taught that rebellious thoughts, if unexpressed, are a
            wrong to the gods, so the resentment in my heart grew. But as it grew there
            slowly drifted into, and curiously blended with it, a blind wonder why my mother
            and Ishi, when hardship came for which they were not to blame, should submit to
            it, not only dutifully and patiently&#x2014;that, of course, it was their place,
            as women, to do&#x2014;but with pride. Something within me cried out that,
            however dutiful they might be in act, their <em>hearts</em> ought
            to rebel; yet I had known both unnecessarily to accept a humiliating blame that
            they knew was not theirs! That those two noble women should encourage
            self-humiliation I resented more bitterly than I did the hard decrees of
            fate.</p>
         
         <p>Of course, this thought was not clear in my mind at that time. Then and for years
            after, my idea of fate&#x2014; for in fate I firmly believed&#x2014;was of a
            vague, floating, stupendous power, for which I felt only resentful wonder.</p>
         
         <p> Another puzzle came one midsummer airing day. It seems odd that it should have
            happened then, for airing days were the most care-free, happy time of the year
            for me. Then the godowns were emptied and long ropes stretched in the sunshine,
            on which were hung torn banners bearing our crest, old field-curtains used in
            the camps of our ancestors, ancient regalia of house officers, and many
            odd-shaped garments belonging to what Ishi's fairy tales called &#x201c;the olden,
            olden time.&#x201d; Beneath the low eaves were piles of clumsy horse armour
            bound with faded ropes of twisted silk; and old war weapons&#x2014;spears,
            battle-axes, bows, and sheaves of arrows&#x2014;stood in out-of-the-way corners
            of the garden. All available space was utilized; even the bridge-posts and the
            stone lanterns were decorated with chain-silk armour and lacquer helmets with
            fearful masks.</p>
         
         <p>The confusion was delightful. I loved it. And Father would walk around with me,
            showing me things and explaining their use, until, all perspiring and with eyes
            dazzled by the sun, we would go indoors and stumble through the cluttered-up
            halls to Honourable Grandmother's room. That seemed to be the only place in the
            house in order. Everywhere else were busy servants brushing, folding, or
            carrying, and at the same time all chattering gayly; for airing days, although
            bringing hard work, were a happy diversion in our rather monotonous household
            and always cordially welcomed by the servants.</p>
         
         <p>When Father and I reached Honourable Grandmother's room we found ourselves
            suddenly shut away from all the turmoil into a place cool and quiet. I can see
            Father now, as, with a sigh of satisfaction, he closed the door behind him and,
            pushing aside the proffered cushion, bowed his thanks to Honourable Grandmother
            and seated himself on the cool straw mat beside the open doors overlooking the
            shady &#x201c;wild garden.&#x201d; There he would sit, fanning himself and talking with
            Honourable Grandmother of old times.</p>
         
         <p>Once, just after the noon meal of hot whale soup and eggplant, which was always
            served on airing days, Father went directly to his room. I was hurrying after
            him when I saw Jiya and another manservant in their stiff crestdresses crossing
            the garden from the godown. They were carrying, reverentially, a whitewood chest
            shaped like a temple box for sacred books. On the front, very large, was our
            crest, and around it was tied a straw rope with dangling Shinto papers. Many
            times I had seen that chest in the godown, standing alone on a whitewood
            platform. It held family heirlooms, some of them centuries old. The men were on
            their way to a certain room which Mother had prepared, where the chest would be
            opened in silence, and the sacred articles carefully examined by men in
            ceremonial garments.</p>
         
         <p> I sat down listlessly on the edge of the porch, for I knew that Father, dressed
            in his stately <a href="#def5">kamishimo</a> garments, would
            soon go to the room where the heirloom chest had been taken, and I should see
            him no more that afternoon. On airing days I generally followed him wherever he
            went, but across the threshold of that room I should not be allowed to step. I
            did not wonder why. It had always been so.</p>
         
         <p>But as I sat alone on the porch I began to think, and after a while I hunted up
            Ishi.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;Ishi,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I go everywhere else with Father. Why cannot I be with
            him in the room where they are airing the sacred things?&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;<a href="#Etsu">Etsu-bo Sama</a>,&#x201d; she replied in the most
            matter-of-fact tone, as she shook out the long fringe of an old-fashioned
            incense ball, &#x201c;it is because you were born a daughter to your father instead
            of a son.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>I felt that her words were a personal reproach, and with the age-old, patient
            submission of the Japanese woman, I walked slowly toward Honourable
            Grandmother's room. It was comforting to turn my mind toward my stately, noble
            grandmother, to whom the entire household, even Father, looked up with
            reverence. Then, suddenly, like a breath of cold wind, came the thought that
            even my saintly grandmother would not dare touch the sacred things that were
            used to honour the Shinto gods. She always attended to the Buddhist shrine, but
            it was Father's duty to care for the white Shinto shrine. During his absence,
            Jiya or another manservant took his place, for no woman was worthy to handle
            such holy things. And yet the great god of Shinto was a woman&#x2014;the Sun
            goddess!<a href="#note2">*</a></p>
         
         <p>That night I was bold enough to ask my father if his honourable mother was an
            unworthy woman like all others.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;What do you think, little Daughter?&#x201d; he asked, after a moment's
            hesitation.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;It cannot be,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;You honour her too greatly for it to be
            true.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>He smiled and tenderly touched my head with his hand.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;Continue to believe so, little Daughter,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;And yet do
            not forget the stern teachings of your childhood. They form the current of a
            crystal stream that, as it flows through the ages, keeps Japanese women
            worthy&#x2014;like your grandmother.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>It was not until long, long afterward, when the knowledge of later years had
            broadened my mind, that I comprehended his hidden meaning that a woman may
            quietly harbour independent thought if she does not allow it to destroy her
            gentle womanhood. The night that this thought came to me I wrote in my diary:
            &#x201c;Useless sacrifice leads to&#x2014;only a sigh. Self-respect leads
            to&#x2014;freedom and hope.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>Beyond the wall on one side of our school was a rough path leading past several
            small villages, with ricefields and patches of clover scattered between. One
            day, when a teacher was taking a group of us girls for a walk, we came upon a
            dry ricefield dotted with wild flowers. We were gathering them with merry
            chattering and laughter when two village farmers passed by, walking slowly and
            watching us curiously.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;What is the world coming to,&#x201d; said one, &#x201c;when workable-age young
            misses waste time wandering about through bushes and wild grass?&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;They are grasshoppers trying to climb the mountain,&#x201d; the other replied,
            &#x201c;but the sun will scorch them with scorn. There can be only pity for the
            young man who takes one of those for his bride.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>The men were rough and ignorant, but they were men: and though we all laughed,
            not one of the girls was far enough from the shackles of her mother's day not to
            feel a shadow of discomfort as we walked homeward.</p>
         
         <p>The teacher paused as we came to the moss-covered stone wall of an old shrine and
            pointed to a near-by cherry tree, young and thrifty, growing out of the hollow
            of another tree whose fallen trunk was so old and twisted that it looked like a
            rough-scaled dragon. Beside it was one of the wooden standards so often seen in
            an artistic or noted spot. On the tablet was inscribed the poem:</p>
         
         <blockquote> &#x201c;The blossoms of to-day draw strength from the roots of a thousand years
            ago.&#x201d; </blockquote>
         
         <p>&#x201c;This tree is like you girls,&#x201d; said the teacher, with a smile. &#x201c;Japan&#x2019;s
            beautiful old civilization has given its strength to you young women of
            to-day. Now it is your duty to grow bravely and give to new Japan, in
            return, a greater strength and beauty than even the old possessed. Do not
            forget!&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>We walked on homeward. Just as we reached our gate in the hedge wall one of the
            girls, who had been rather quiet, turned to me.</p>
         
         <p>&#x201c;Nevertheless,&#x201d; she said, defiantly, &#x201c;the grasshoppers are climbing the
            mountain into the sunlight.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>As I learned to value womanhood, I realized more and more that my love of freedom
            and my belief in my right to grow toward it meant more than freedom to act, to
            talk, to think. Freedom also claimed a spiritual right to grow.</p>
         
         <p>I do not know exactly how I became a Christian. It was not a sudden thing. It
            seems to have been a natural spiritual development&#x2014;so natural that only a
            few puzzles stand out clearly as I look back along the path. As I read, and
            thought, and felt, my soul reached out into the unknown; and gradually, easily,
            almost unconsciously, I drifted out of a faith of philosophy, mysticism, and
            resignation into one of high ideals, freedom, cheerfulness, and hope.</p>
         
         <p>Of the wonder and glory of what I consider the greatest faith of the world I do
            not speak. Of that many know. And the selfish gain to me is beyond all words of
            all languages.</p>
         
         <p>When I was sent to the mission school the fact that the teachers were of another
            religion was not considered at all. They were thought of only as teachers of the
            language and manners of America; so when I wrote to Mother, asking her consent
            to my becoming a Christian, I know she was greatly surprised. But she was a wise
            woman. She replied, &#x201c;My daughter, this is an important thing. I think it will
            be best for you to wait until vacation. Then we will talk of it.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>So I postponed being baptized, and when vacation came, I went to <a href="#Nagaoka">Nagaoka</a>. The people there knew little of
            Christianity.<a href="#note3">*</a> The only impression most of them had
            was that it was a curious belief lacking in ceremony, whose converts were
            required to trample upon sacred things<a href="#note4">*</a> There
            existed, especially among the old, a strong distaste against <a href="">Jakyo</a>, the evil sect,
            but it held no vital, forceful bitterness. The people of <a href="#Nagaoka">Nagaoka</a> looked upon the stories of Japan's
            Christian martyrs<a href="#note5">*</a> as a distant and pitiful thing;
            but they had none of the shuddering horror felt in some communities of southern
            Japan, whose memories of the tragedies of four centuries ago had reason to
            live.</p>
         
         <p>My mother, who had learned from Father to be tolerant of the opinions of others,
            had no prejudice against the new religion; but she believed that the great duty
            in life for sons and daughters consisted in a rigid observance of the ritual for
            ancestor-worship and the ceremonies in memory of the dead. When I first reached
            home her heart was heavy with dread, but when she learned that my new faith did
            not require disrespect to ancestors, her relief and gratitude were pathetic, and
            she readily gave her consent.</p>
         
         <p>But Honourable Grandmother! My proud, loyal grandmother! It was impossible for
            her to understand, and I think my becoming a heretic was to her a lifelong
            sorrow. Her grief was my heaviest cross.</p>
         
         <p>It was hard, too, to visit my relatives and friends. They looked upon me as a
            curiosity, and my mother was in a continual state of explanation and apology.
            One old aunt closed the doors of her shrine and pasted white paper over them
            that the ancestors might be spared the knowledge of my &#x201c;peculiarity.&#x201d;</p>
         
         <p>Another aunt, who invited me out to dinner, served no fish, feeling that, since I
            was so puzzlingly removed from ordinary life, I could not be feasted in the
            usual way. After discarding one plan after another, she finally concluded it
            would be both harmless and respectful for her to treat me as a priest.</p>
         
         <p>All these things among the friends that I had known from babyhood hurt me. I
            could bravely have borne persecution, but to be set apart as something strange
            almost broke my heart. How I longed for my father! He would have understood, but
            I was alone in the midst of kindly ignorance. Everybody loved me, but they all
            looked at me in helpless pity.</p>
         
         <p>At first I was unhappy, but my three months at home changed everything, both for
            my friends and for myself. When I returned to school I carried with me all the
            respect and love of the home friends that had always been mine, and
            which&#x2014;thank God&#x2014;I have kept until now.</p>
         
         <p>I think I am a true Christian. At least my belief has given me untold comfort and
            a perfect heart-satisfaction, but it has never separated me from my Buddhist
            friends. They have respect for this strange belief of mine; for they feel that,
            although I am loyal to the Christian God, I still keep the utmost reverence for
            my fathers and respect for the faith that was the highest and holiest thing they
            knew.</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2><a id="note1"></a><p>*The Meiji Restoration was an 1868 political revolution that
         reconsolidated power under the Emperor Meiji, ended the feudal rule of the <a href="#def4"><em>daimyos</em></a> and accelerated Japan's
         industrialization and modernization.</p><a id="note2"></a><p>*The Sun goddess of Shinto is known by the name Amaterasu Omikami,
         which means "Great Divinity Illuminating Heaven." She is considered to be the ruler
         of heaven and the ancestress of the Japanese imperial family.</p><a id="note3"></a><p>*Jesuit missionaries arrived in Japan during the 16th century and
         converted over a hundred thousand people to Christianity. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi
         became ruler of Japan, he became suspicious of Christianity as a foreign threat and
         had the religion repressed and its adherents persecuted. The next ruler, Tokugawa
         Ieyasu, issued an edict officially banning Christianity in 1614. Any remaining
         Christians were driven into hiding until religious freedom was re-established during
         the 19th century.</p><a id="note4"></a><p>*The Japanese government would force suspected Christians to
         renounce the faith by stepping on images of Jesus and Mary called <em>fumie</em></p><a id="note5"></a><p>*Twenty-six Christians were executed by crucifixion in Nagasaki in
         1597 and became known as the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan.</p><a id="def1"></a><p><em>Jinrikisha</em>: Japanese term for a two or three

         ruled over most of the land from the 10th century until the <a href="#note1">Meiji Restoration</a>; the word is a combination of <em>dai</em>, which means "large," and <em>myo</em>, a short form of
